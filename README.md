# CHORES

## INTRODUCTION
---
This is a new social networking application :computer: , to provide users a way to earn some extra bucks :moneybag:.
Users will be able to find tasks(chores) :memo: of their liking, near them. Which they could then apply on by answering some questions/resume :question: as asked by the creator of that chore.
This application will give work to the person needing it, and will take the load of the creator's (creator of the task) mind.
